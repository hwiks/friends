### Productivity app for friendships management (herd your loved ones like the cats they are)

Trying to schedule D&D and struggling to keep track of everyone's holidays? Painfully checking food preferences and allergies in view of a dinner party? You could have sworn you had some great gift ideas for your friend but you are blanknig close to their birthday? Worry no more!

Friends is a simple app to keep track of the preferences, likes, dislikes, and crazy schedules of your loved ones. 

Connect your tribe (or different tribes) to organize together events, workshop ideas, and sync calendars.

Friends is also a learning project for me to learn GO! This means I will implement things based on what I want to learn and not strictly what is useful. Wish me luck!
